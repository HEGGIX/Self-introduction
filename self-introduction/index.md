Hi! My name is Gleb. I’m twenty one years old and I’m from Minsk. I hope i’m a future frontend developer. 
I graduated from the Belarusian State University with a degree in HR-manager. Now I’m studying at RS School and at English courses. 
I completed stage A1 and now I’m going to A2. When I was at university I worked at different jobs, but I didn’t like all of them.
I also don’t see myself as a HR-manager, but during my studies I got a lot of useful skills: teamwork, diligence, business communication and so on. 
These skills will be useful in the work of a front-end developer.
My hobbies are traveling, sports, especially football and cycling, movies, listening to music, spending time with friends and so on.
At the beginning of my studies, I liked doing layout more, for me it was more interesting. 
But now it’s changed and I want to focus on JavaScript and other, because it’s harder and it’s a little harder for me.
My main motivation is to prove to myself that I can learn it and that I can find a good job. I have a good example - this is my best friend. 
He himself learned this profession and got a good job. It motivated me a lot. I think I could do it too. 
Of course, I would like to understand all the subtleties and complexities, and learn this profession. 
In the future I want to find a job as a frontend developer and move abroad. Also one of the motivation is travel.
There are two important points – finances and the ability to work from anywhere in the world. And this is all the work of a frontend developer.
In conclusion, I would like to thank RS School, for the fact that you give the opportunity to study different people from different cities and countries absolutely free –
it’s fantastic!
Thank you for your attention!
Bye everyone, see you soon!
